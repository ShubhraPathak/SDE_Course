# Note: In the example above, Singleton doesnâ€™t provide an implementation of .__init__().
# If you ever need a class like this with a .__init__() method, then keep in mind that
# this method will run every time you call the Singleton() constructor.
# This behavior can cause weird initialization effects and bugs.

# first __new__() will run every time and then __init__() is called if required. (based on conditions)
