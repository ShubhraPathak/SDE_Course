# Build a Number guessing game, in which the user selects a range.
# --> A range input from user
# Letâ€™s say User selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer.
# Some random integer will be selected by the system and the user has to guess that
# integer in the minimum number of guesses
# --> randomly generated number from the program
# --> maximum number of attempt provided to user by the formula log2(B-A+1)
